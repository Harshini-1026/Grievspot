# GrievSpot - Grievance Management System

This is a Java console application designed to manage and streamline the grievance redressal process within a social environment. It allows users (Complainants) to log in, submit grievances, and view their submitted issues. Admin-side features can be extended as needed. Grievances are stored persistently and notifications are triggered upon submission.

This project serves as a practical implementation for understanding file handling, object-oriented programming, and basic user authentication in Java. Modify and build upon it to fit more complex needs.
